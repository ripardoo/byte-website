    <h2>A unique chance to spend eight days in Silicon Valley to meet world-class builders and operators</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We're organizing an eight day long trip for eight exceptional individuals to the heart of the technological world, Silicon Valley, in January 2025. The trip will focus on connecting a small group of highly driven young builders to world-class role models. All participants are expected to work on a side-project before and throughout the trip, and will end up showcasing this project while there.</p>

    <p>We are looking for exceptional participants. Exceptionality is impossible to define with objective criteria, but if you are very driven and ambitious or have succeeded with anything on a global scale (science olympics, sports, gaming, hackathons…): apply!</p>

    <p>The chosen participants will take part in a prep-module in Finland, where they will meet some of the most successful tech-founders of the country. These meetings are designed to both inspire and help you further with your project.</p>

    <p>The trip will not contain visits to large tech companies or popular attractions. Instead participants get to have 1:1 chats with the best technical founders in Silicon valley and spend time outside of the meetings working on their projects and intrests. The trip will end with you showcasing your progress to an audience of founders, investors and operators</p>

    <p><a href="form/index.html">Apply here</a> before midnight on November 30th.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>What constitutes a project?</h3>
    <p>The project your working on can be anything, though it will be very helpful if it is at least one of the two following: 1) technical & 2) somehow monetizeable. In today's age the second criteria is mostly about imagination. You do not need to be far along to apply; we appreciate complex products equally to quickly put together prototypes as long as you have the hunger to develop them much further.</p>

    <h3>What if I don't have a side-project?</h3>
    <p>Start one. It does not need to be insanely complex, we just want to see that you are able to meaningfully progress something you care about.</p>

    <h3>Do I need some prior experience?</h3>
    <p>No you do not. We are looking for young people with a bright future rather than a bright past.</p>

    <h3>Who can apply?</h3>
    <p>To apply you need to be a Finnish citizen or permanent resident and be under 25 years old.</p>

    <h3>When are we going?</h3>
    <p>January 8-16th.</p>

    <h3>How much does this cost?</h3>
    <p>Participation for the chosen individuals will be free aside from your personal expenses and visa (food, hygiene etc.) during the trip</p>
