    <h2>Spend eight days in Silicon Valley to meet world-class founders and operators building the future</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We're organizing our second eight day long trip for eight exceptional individuals to the heart of the technological world, Silicon Valley, in March 2026. The trip will focus on connecting a small group of highly driven young builders to world-class role models, creating the future with technology.</p>

    <p>We are looking for exceptional participants. Exceptionality is impossible to define with objective criteria, but if you are very driven and ambitious or have succeeded with anything on a global scale (science olympics, sports, gaming, hackathons…): apply!</p>

    <p>If you have your own startup, mention that in the application & be prepared to put extra effort into securing highly-relevant meetings for yourself. We’re very open to participants following their own agenda for a valuable outcome.</p>

    <p>Every chosen participant is expected to put effort into the trip to draw the most value out of it. You do not need to have any relevant experience for this but it will take some time & effort prior to the trip.</p>

    <p>Our focus is not on visiting big-tech or popular attractions. Instead participants get to have individual and group chats with the best technology-founders and interesting people building the big tech of the future. This will provide a phenomenal chance to get world-class perspectives on something you’re currently working on.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>Who should apply?</h3>
    <p>We’re looking for people who want to make meaningful changes happen with their time. High-agency builders, hustlers and big thinkers. It is extremely helpful to be highly technical or exceptional in some way. This likely means you have some interesting experience with personal projects that are technical and/or somehow monetizeable. In today's age the second angle is mostly about imagination.</p>

    <h3>So, do I need to have some project to showcase?</h3>
    <p>You do not need to have past personal projects to apply but we want to somehow see that you are able to meaningfully progress something you care about. We appreciate complex products equally to quickly put together prototypes as long as you have the hunger to develop them much further. Even small-scale or unfinished projects are interesting but be sure to describe where they are headed and why you haven’t yet gotten there</p>

    <h3>Do I need some prior experience?</h3>
    <p>No you do not. We are looking for young people with a bright future rather than a bright past.</p>

    <h3>Who can apply?</h3>
    <p>To apply you need to be a Finnish citizen or permanent resident and be under 25 years old.</p>

    <h3>When are we going?</h3>
    <p>Early March. Exact dates will be updated here in about a week</p>

    <h3>How much does this cost?</h3>
    <p>Participation for the chosen individuals will be free aside from your personal expenses and visa (food, hygiene etc.) during the trip</p>
